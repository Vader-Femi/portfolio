I create apps for Mobile & Wear OS with Flutter, Jetpack Compose, and modern development architectures. Whether itâ€™s building smooth, intuitive UIs or structuring scalable app architectures, I thrive on creating seamless mobile experiences.

With a BSc in Computer Science and 2 years of professional coding under my belt, Iâ€™ve worked with Kotlin, Flutter, Dart, and Jetpack Compose. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of mobile tech, staying ahead of trends, and optimizing every pixel and line of code.

 More than just a developer, Iâ€™m a relentless learner. Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to improve, always ready to tackle challenges, and always striving to build something extraordinary. Letâ€™s create something amazing! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥
