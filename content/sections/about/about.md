I am an Android developer and computer scientist with a strong track record in developing and delivering high-quality Android and Wear OS applications using my skills in Jetpack Compose and Android Architecture Patterns.

I have been coding professional for a year now and I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science. I have experience with a variety of Android development tools and technologies from Kotlin, MVVM and MVI, Dependency Injection, Jetpack Compose, Wear OS Development amongst others.

Finally I am a hard worker and I am eager to learn. I am always willing to go the extra mile, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills. :)
